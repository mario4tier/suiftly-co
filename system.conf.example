# System Configuration File
# Copy to system.conf and set ENVIRONMENT for your deployment

# Environment: development, staging, production
# CRITICAL: Setting ENVIRONMENT=production blocks dangerous dev scripts
ENVIRONMENT=development

# Database Configuration (optional - overrides defaults)
# DB_HOST=localhost
# DB_USER=deploy
# DB_PASSWORD=deploy_password_change_me
# DB_NAME=suiftly_dev

# Production Safety Notes:
# =======================
# 1. NEVER set ENVIRONMENT=production on development machines
# 2. Production servers MUST have ENVIRONMENT=production in system.conf
# 3. Dev scripts (reset-database.sh, squash-migrations.sh) will refuse to run in production
# 4. This file should be in .gitignore (never commit actual system.conf)
