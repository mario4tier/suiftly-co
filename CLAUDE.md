# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

**suiftly-co** - A new repository currently in initial setup phase.

Repository: https://github.com/mario4tier/suiftly-co

## Current Status

This repository is in its initial stage with no established codebase yet. When developing this project:

1. **Check for Updates**: This CLAUDE.md should be updated as the project evolves with:
   - Chosen technology stack and architecture
   - Build, test, and development commands
   - Project structure and key architectural decisions

2. **Project Name Context**: The name "suiftly-co" may suggest a Sui blockchain-related project. Confirm the project's purpose and technology choices with the user before making architectural decisions.

## Development Guidelines

Until the project structure is established:
- Ask the user about the intended technology stack if unclear
- Follow the conventions of the chosen framework/language once determined
- Update this CLAUDE.md file as the project structure emerges

## Notes

- No existing build/test/lint commands yet
- No established architecture patterns yet
- No dependencies configured yet

This file should be updated as the project develops to include:
- Common development commands
- High-level architecture overview
- Key patterns and conventions specific to this codebase
